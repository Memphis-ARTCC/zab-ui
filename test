This is highly situational dependent and should only be used if your intent is to put an a/c in LUAW at an airport without safety logic.\n\n- Before sending aircraft to departure, make sure they're airborne through 1,000 at least. Sending them to departure 100ft above the runway is a little too soon.\n\n- When using range rings on a STARS or TDW display, remember that the rings are centered on the airport..not the start of the runway. So that 2mi ring is actually ~1.25 miles from the start of the runway.\n\n- Be very careful with \"cleared for the option\" when its busy. Generally you want to make sure they don't do a stop and go.\n\n- When you intend to use \"follow that traffic\", aircraft need to first have the aircraft in sight. \"N123AB, traffic is an A320 on a 3 mile final, report in sight\" then issue \"..follow that traffic..\"\n\nWe'll practice more with this stuff next time.

                "studentNotes": "Worked IFR/VFR consolidated with Henry. Here are some notes:\n\n\nWhen you use LUAW, it shouldn't be used for every single departure. There are times where it is needed, but if you use it on every single departure at an airport like FSM, you can't issue landing clearances until that aircraft is on the roll.\n- Additionally, once an aircraft is cleared for takeoff (released from LUAW) you can issue the landing clearance. You do not need to wait until the aircraft is off the runway to issue the landing clearance.\n- LUAW phraseology: [Callsign] [Runway] [line up and wait]. Ex:// \"N123AB, runway 8 lineup and wait\"\n\n- Every single time you issue a continue approach instruction, it adds to your workload because you have to come back to those aircraft with a landing clearance...and it can't be when they're less than 200ft above the runway. If a/c aren't cleared to land by a 2.5 mile final, they will for sure call you and ask for it. \n\n- BE CAREFUL WITH STOP AND GO! If you don't tell the aircraft unable stop and go, you risk them bogging up the whole scenario.\n\n- RANGE RINGS. Remember that the range rings are centered around the AIRPORT not the start of the runway. So when using 2mi rings, the first ring is only ~ 1.25 miles from the runway.\n\n- Go arounds: When you have go arounds, you need to issue them a heading to fly and an altitude to maintain unless on a published missed approach. You also need to coordinate with departure.\n\n- When aircraft depart, do not ship them to departure the second they lift off the runway. Departure is not going to radar identify them at 100ft above the runway anyway... wait until their at least at 1,000ft and in a positive climb.\n\n- When you issue traffic to follow, make sure you first make sure that the aircraft that will follow the other has that traffic in sight \"N123AB, traffic is a E170 on a 3 mile final, report in sight\" THEN, if in sight, issue \"follow that traffic\". Nothing is worse than someone following the wrong aircraft.\n\nFocus on efficiency!!! ",

They are key to your success. Keep it to a script: (callsign, Traffic, (direction), (how far) miles, (aircraft type if known), (intentions/direction of flight).\n\n- Don't over complicated everything, if there is a conflict with 2 landing aircraft, tell them to go around.\n\n- Pick up the tracks for aircraft that will transit your tower airspace\n* Including departing aircraft with no flight following and arriving aircraft.\n\nNext session, we will review VFR concepts ",

Another note on this, try and utilize more than one taxiway so you dont get put in a situation like we were in a couple times today -  you are the ground controller and YOU have jurisdiction over the taxiways (-S). REALLY REALLY be vigilant about a/c getting to close, they get priority over a clearance 10/10 times!\n\nFind a balance between getting a clearance in a timely manner and getting an accurate clearance out. We dont want to be in the middle of giving a clearance, just for us to stop and realize we need to fix something else too\n\nDouble check for errors! - ALT, SUFFIX, A/C TYPE, ROUTE... ETC!\n\nWe discussed when and how to use PDC's - super important!\n\nUse \"follow\" when applicable - makes your life a lot easier\n\nAlways remember to breathe, I know it seems silly, but make sure if you get overwhelmed or there is a lot of things happening, take a quick moment to just inahle-exhale, trust me, it helps : ) \n\nExpect to run this same type of sweatbox next time -  again, nice job today!",

                "studentNotes": "Solid work today Henry! Just a few notes from our session:\n\n- Controller Briefing: When you swap out another controller, they will inform you of everything happening at that point in time including but not limited to: who has a clearance, who is taxiing, current weather, etc. Once they get done telling you all of this important information, they will ask if there are any questions, if so, ask them, if not, they will then say \"your control\" along with their operating initials, respond with \"my control\" and your operating initials. \n\n- SPEED: Try to work on getting clearances out quicker, aircraft were still having to wait a couple of minutes before getting their clearance, we want to reduce that wait time to be as minimal as possible. \n\n- Push and Start/Squawk: If you see that an aircraft will need to push onto a taxiway, after you give them their clearance, tell them \"advise when ready for push and start\". Ensure that aircraft are squawking Mode C and their discrete beacon code prior to pushing or taxiing. \n\n- Inbound Taxi: For arrival aircraft, unless they give you a gate number, spot number or a specific ramp that they want to go to, you can presume they want to go to the nearest applicable ramp that they would normally go to (Fedex go to the FDX ramp at the north of the airport, DAL/SWA/JIA and others will go the terminal, etc.). \n\nFocus on these few things and you will have your S1 soon enough!

If you do not know it check Flight Plan remarks or ask the pilot what the callsign is\n- Be sure to have all necessary charts and such open to avoid confusion or wait times\n- Don't let aircraft wait at the runway hold short, hand them over to twr little before they get there\n- Use \"standby\" instead of \"hang on for a sec\"\n- Study SOP/LOA/ and charts. We want to be able to understand and know our airport(s)\n- VFR into and out of the class bravo should be given at or below 2500\n- unless #2 or more there should be no wait time for clearances with no other traffic\n- Be sure to issue read back correct when a pilot reads their clearance back properly\n- End coordination with other controllers with your operating initials to ensure acknowledgement\n\nClearances and needed amended are there just need to work on the speed of getting instructions or clearances out.

X to cross Runway Y at (Taxiway) Z\") (\"Local, Ground.. Crossing Complete\")\n\n- Taxi Instructions \"(Callsign), Runway (RWY), Taxi via (Route), [Cross/ Hold Short (RWY/ TWY)]\n\n- Aircraft along V, J, and N need to be given push: (callsign), push back approved, face east/west.\n \n- We can't see aircraft on ASDEX until they have gotten their squawk through their clearance.\n\n- Make sure you say \"airport\" in the clearance limit portion of their clearance. It is very important since you can clear an aircraft to a VOR, waypoint, etc. Ex. By saying: \"Cleared to Kennedy\", are you clearing them to the VOR or the airport?\n\n- Make sure you check for those night time departures. They interfere with arrivals and are very important to reroute them to an appropriate SID.\n\n- Use the departure reference to determine what the preferred runway is for that departure.\n\nKeep practicing.

Put in there suffix, requested altitude (if they did not file or request one - just put the \"VFR/025 or VFR/013\" based on whatever they are doing) - in the route section of their FP put what they are doing (if there is not a route of flight) - I.E. Pattern, Northbound, Eastbound, etc.... and put FF+ or FF- IF APPLICABLE\n\n***VFR Departure - \"a/c cleared OUT of the class bravo airspace, maintain VFR at or below 2500, departure freq XXX, squawk XXX\"\n\nVFR Pattern - \"a/c cleared INTO the class bravo airspace, maintain VFR at or below 1300 (prop) or 1800 (jet), XXX, squawk XXX\"***\n\nGreat job - expect to do ground movements with some more clearance stuff!",

                "studentNotes": "Henry, \n\n***I am going to include some theory notes, as I do not believe any notes were inputed for your first session: ***\n\nAirspaces (refer to this link for more info) - https://pilotinstitute.com/airspace-explained/ \n\n**Altitude for direction of flight (N-EODD/S-WEVEN)*** -  “North‑East Odd, South‑West Even” - (RVSM starts at FL290+)if an aircraft is flying north/east they must be @an odd altitude (FL230, FL250, FL310) and @an even altitude for going south/west (FL320, FL240, FL360) - Above FL410, only odd flight levels are assigned (FL410, FL430, FL450, etc.), increments by 4000, starting at FL410 and with a 2000 offset for a/c flying west/south\n\nCraft acronym: C - clearance, R - route, A - altitude, F - frequency, T - transponder (squawk)\n\nRemember out three types of sids - Pilot nav, radar vector, and hybrid!\n\nEquipment suffixes - https://www.touringmachine.com/images/Aircraft_Classification.png - Important ones are /L, /G, /A, /W, /Z!\n\nWe discussed Navigational Equipment (RNAV, GNSS, TACAN, VOR, NDB) - keep this in mind!\n\nWe went over the setup with CRC - Play around with it and get comfortable, here are the CRC docs (suggest that you read over them if you have some time!) - https://crc.virtualnas.net/docs/#/asdex\n\nStart to observe when able, and go over relevant documents on the website (SOPs, LOAs, etc) - there are also some really great YT videos out there if your looking for some exposure to what you will be doing!\n\n\n***Resources:****\nRouting - https://www.flightaware.com/ \nSky vector (I like this as well to help with direction of flight as well as seeing the aircrafts route, skyvector has many useful features) - https://skyvector.com/ \nCharts - Navigraph (if you ever need different charts - chartfox does the job as well)\nMem Departure ref - https://memphis-artcc.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/downloads/1702242607073-MEM%20Departure%20Reference%20(5).pdf\nZME ref card - https://memphis-artcc.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/downloads/1737569215490-zmerefcard.pdf\nLiveATC - great resource to see real world application\n7110.65 (you can find a bunch of phraseology and standard ATC procedures in here!)- https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/\n\n****NOTES FROM TODAY:****\n\nRemember to identify yourself ALWAYS on initial contact - \"Memphis delivery\" \"Memphis Ground\"\n\n Use sky vector if unsure about where the airport is located in regards to correct altitude for direction of flight - type in the airport and a little cross-thingy will come up and you can see if it is N/E/S/W of Memphis!\n\n***Props go on the ELVIS4 Departures!!*** - Google it if you do not know an aircraft type. /W must also go on the ELVIS4 departure because they are non-rnav. JETS may also file for the ELVIS, there is nothing wrong with this\n\nWe talked about how the departure reference is super important for runway selection, valid departures for the time, and how if you have a prop that filed for an RNAV you can use the corresponding ELVIS fix to reroute -the reference card is also super helpful!\n\nAlso, remember flight aware IFR analyzer is great for re-routing if needed!\n\nYour job as the DEL/GND controller is to make sure (in terms of the route) the departure and then there transition/fix is valid, do not worry about everything else in the route\n\nIf an aircraft is /G, or /A along with ofc the many other suffixes; remember they are non RVSM, meaning they need an altitude below FL290\n\nWe talked about how to see if a/c are mode C via the stars display - if you just see the a/c type in the STARS datablock, remember they are not mode C - if you see the destination airport with the a/c type, they ARE mode C\n\nRemember the \"Heavy\" tag appended to the end of the callsign if the a/c IS a heavy a/c - easy way to tell is, if an a/c tag on asdex/stars is orange, it is heavy!\n\n\n***Phraseology:***\n\nInitial contact for clearance - \"Aircraft XX clearance on request, standby #XX\"\nLetting the a/c know you have the clearance - \"Aircraft XX clearance available advise ready to copy\"\nAltitude change - \"Aircraft XX altitude is incorrect for direction of flight, I can offer you... [fill in the blank]\"\nThe clearance itself - \"Cleared to XXX via XX departure XX transition [or \"radar vectors to the ELVIS4 departure fix\"] then as filed, maintain XX expect XX one-zero minutes after departure, departure frequency XX squawk XX\" - Please note, this is the standard IFR clearance, it will change based on the route or VFR/IFR or other factors in the FP - you will go over more of this in your next session!\nDeparture freq - ex: \"one-two-five--**point**--eight\"\nRead back correct - \"Aircraft XX read back correct, push and start your discretion OR advise ready for push [if you are GND as well], expect runway XXX\"\nRead back incorrect - \"Aircraft XX negative [state the error]\"\nRepeat callsign - \"Aircraft calling, say callsign\"\n\n***Next session:** Plan to do some more IFR clearances with VFR clearances!",
